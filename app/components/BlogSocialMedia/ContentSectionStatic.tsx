              The conversations at the summit reinforced a clear direction. Influence
              is no longer evaluated by scale alone. It is assessed by relevance,
              structure, and measurable contribution to business goals.

            <p className="text-font19 text-[#77787B] mb-[16px]">
              Follower count and reach are no longer sufficient indicators of influence.
              What matters is how effectively brands and creators engage the right
              audience and deliver outcomes aligned with business objectives.

            <p className="text-font19 text-[#77787B] mt-4">
              Brands are increasingly demanding accountability from influencer
              campaigns, with success defined by trust, qualified engagement, and
              long-term brand value rather than impressions alone.

                Creator Economy: Maturity Over Momentum  </h3>
                <p className='text-font19 text-[#77787B] mb-[16px]'>Another key theme was the maturity of the creator economy. Creators are no longer 
viewed only as content producers. They now operate as business entities, media 
owners, and long-term brand partners. </p>
 <p className="text-font19 text-[#77787B] mb-[16px]">This shift is driving a move away from one off collaborations toward sustained 
partnerships built on alignment, consistency, and shared objectives. </p>
 <h3 className="text-30 my-[30px] my-3">Performance Led Influence  </h3>
  <p className="text-font19 text-[#77787B] mb-[16px]">Performance emerged as a central theme across sessions. Data backed creator 
selection, platform insights, and continuous optimization are now standard expectations.  </p>
 <p className="text-font19 text-[#77787B] mb-[16px]">Brands are aligning creator strategies directly with business objectives rather than 
broad awareness goals. The outcome is an influence that delivers clarity and efficiency 
instead of noise. </p>
 <p className="text-font19 text-[#77787B] mb-[25px]">These conversations reinforced a practical reality. Influence has become a disciplined, 
performance-driven function. GS Digital’s participation ensures we stay closely aligned 
with how this discipline continues to evolve.

            </h2>
             <p className="text-font19 text-[#77787B] mb-[16px]">Purpose driven storytelling emerged as a defining theme. Content is no longer evaluated only by reach, but by the values it represents and the responsibility behind it. </p>
             <p className="text-font19 text-[#77787B] mb-[16px]">As influence scales, accountability increases. Brands and creators are expected to operate with ethical awareness, social responsibility, and cultural sensitivity. Purpose is no longer an added layer. It is part of how credibility is built. </p>
             <p className="text-font19 text-[#77787B] mb-[16px]"><strong>Key areas of emphasis included</strong></p>
            <ul className="list-disc pl-10 mt-3 mb-[24px]">

</h2>
 <p className="text-font19 text-[#77787B] mb-[16px]">For brands operating in the UAE and other high growth markets, the summit underscored a practical shift. Influence must be intentional, accountable, and tied directly to business outcomes.

 <p className="text-font19 text-[#77787B] mb-[16px]">The 1 Billion Followers Summit reinforced a simple but important reality. Digital attention is becoming more selective and increasingly tied to trust. </p>
 <p className="text-font19 text-[#77787B] mb-[16px]">Influence today extends beyond visibility. It shapes perception, drives cultural relevance, and supports long-term business growth.
